# Scrape BBRef for FL Players
The point of this is to acquire career stats for Frontier League players. Specifically for my purpose, I have my Frontier League Shiny app that scrapes FL stats from frontierleague.com, but also has Yakkertech data for other metrics. 
I wanted to add a player page where it contains their career stats from BBRef.
